    <div class="answer_blk">
    <p>We need both the front and back shots of your HKID to complete identity verification for you without a branch visit.
    <br>
    <br>
    During photo shooting, please ensure adequate and steady lighting. <br>
    <br>
    Make sure there is no shadow or glare cast over your HKID, and the image is clearly visible and not out of focus.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    Some of the factors which may result in unsuccessful identity verification, say, bright light, scratches and wear &amp; tear on the card surface may affect the accuracy of the system in carrying out identity verification by making comparisons with your selfies
     and HKID. <br>
    <br>
    The above factors may make it impossible for the system to detect a valid HKID in order to complete the identity verification. In this case, please visit any of our branches for account opening.</p>
